# Public Test Artifacts

## Rule

Public test artifacts must look like ordinary low-value consumer items. Do not reveal why the artifact exists, what system is testing it, who built it, or what internal workflow it exercises.

## Public Content

Use generic item content:

- Title: `Test T-Shirt`, `Plain Black T-Shirt`, `Basic Watch`, `Sample Mug`
- Description: `Plain test item.`
- Images: simple product-style images without internal text or logos
- Price: lowest accepted price for the marketplace

Avoid public strings such as:

- Internal company, repo, app, product, or project names
- `API`, `poller`, `webhook`, `automation`, `bot`, `script`, `reserved`, `internal`, `delete me`
- Database identifiers, handles, table/column names, tokens, account ids, URLs, endpoints, branch names
- Business logic, arbitrage strategy, marketplace sync details, source merchants, sell-side workflows

## Private Traceability

Store test purpose and internal linkage only in private systems:

- Database `raw_payload` or private notes may say the item is for a poller or integration test.
- Public marketplace fields must stay generic.
- Console logs may include private ids only when they are not being posted publicly.

Before publishing or updating a live artifact, inspect the exact public payload fields and remove internal strings.
