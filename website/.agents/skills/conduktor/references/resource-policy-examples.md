# ResourcePolicy examples

Resource policies (`apiVersion: self-serve/v1`, `kind: ResourcePolicy`) enforce CEL-expression-based rules on resources. They can target `Topic`, `Connector`, `Subject`, or `ApplicationGroup` via `spec.targetKind`. Policies are not applied automatically — link them via `spec.policyRef` on an Application or ApplicationInstance, or via `spec.policiesRef` on a KafkaCluster or KafkaConnectCluster. Only AdminTokens can manage policies.

Below are starter policies for self-service. They mirror the policies that ship with the official [conduktor/self-service-template](https://github.com/conduktor/self-service-template) repo — clone the template to get them in place rather than hand-copying. Tune the values to match your environment.

## Topic naming (`topic-naming.yml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: self-serve/v1
kind: ResourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: topic-naming
spec:
  targetKind: Topic
  description: "Enforces topic naming convention"
  rules:
    - condition: metadata.name.matches("^[a-z0-9-]+\\.[a-z0-9.-]+$")
      errorMessage: "Topic name must follow the pattern <app>.<descriptive-name>"
```

## Topic label conventions (`topic-labels.yml`)

Enforces the standard label set on every topic, matching the convention in the [official self-service template](https://github.com/conduktor/self-service-template). Adapt the allowed values to match your organization. Uses `"key" in metadata.labels` (not `has()`) because hyphenated keys require bracket notation in CEL.

The `instance` label aligns with the `ApplicationInstance` resource name and the `<instance>` folder slot in the repo. It is more flexible than `env` — an instance can correspond to environment, region, data classification, regulatory domain, workload tier, or tenant. If your org already uses an `env` label, substitute it; just keep the label name consistent across topics, ApplicationInstances, and the folder structure.

```yaml
apiVersion: self-serve/v1
kind: ResourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: topic-labels
spec:
  targetKind: Topic
  description: "Enforces required labels on topics"
  rules:
    - condition: has(metadata.labels.instance) && metadata.labels["instance"] in ["dev", "stag", "prod"]
      errorMessage: "Topics must have an 'instance' label set to one of: dev, stag, prod"
    - condition: >
        "business-unit" in metadata.labels
        && metadata.labels["business-unit"].size() > 0
      errorMessage: "Topics must have a 'business-unit' label (e.g., finance, logistics, risk)"
    - condition: has(metadata.labels.confidentiality) && metadata.labels["confidentiality"] in ["public", "internal", "restricted"]
      errorMessage: "Topics must have a 'confidentiality' label set to one of: public, internal, restricted"
    - condition: has(metadata.labels.team) && metadata.labels["team"].size() > 0
      errorMessage: "Topics must have a 'team' label identifying the owning team"
```

## Dev topic rules (`topic-rules-dev.yml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: self-serve/v1
kind: ResourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: topic-rules-dev
spec:
  targetKind: Topic
  description: "Relaxed topic rules for dev environments"
  rules:
    - condition: spec.replicationFactor >= 1
      errorMessage: "Replication factor has to be at least 1"
    - condition: spec.partitions >= 1 && spec.partitions <= 3
      errorMessage: "Partition count has to be between 1 and 3"
```

## Prod topic rules (`topic-rules-prod.yml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: self-serve/v1
kind: ResourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: topic-rules-prod
spec:
  targetKind: Topic
  description: "Strict topic rules for production environments"
  rules:
    - condition: spec.replicationFactor == 3
      errorMessage: "Replication factor has to be exactly 3 in production"
    - condition: spec.partitions >= 1 && spec.partitions <= 12
      errorMessage: "Production topics need less than or equal to 12 partitions. If you need an exception, plead your case to the platform team."
    - condition: "\"retention.ms\" in spec.configs && int(string(spec.configs[\"retention.ms\"])) >= 3600000"
      errorMessage: "Retention has to be explicitly set and at least 1 hour in production"
    - condition: "\"min.insync.replicas\" in spec.configs && int(string(spec.configs[\"min.insync.replicas\"])) >= 2"
      errorMessage: "min.insync.replicas has to be at least 2 in production"
```

## Subject rules (`subject-rules.yml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: self-serve/v1
kind: ResourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: subject-rules
spec:
  targetKind: Subject
  description: "Enforces subject naming and compatibility standards"
  rules:
    - condition: metadata.name.matches("^[a-z0-9-]+\\.[a-z0-9.-]+-(?:key|value)$")
      errorMessage: "Subject name must end with -key or -value suffix"
    - condition: has(spec.compatibility) && spec.compatibility in ["BACKWARD", "BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE", "FORWARD", "FORWARD_TRANSITIVE", "FULL", "FULL_TRANSITIVE"]
      errorMessage: "Compatibility level has to be explicitly set and cannot be NONE"
```

## Connector rules (`connector-rules.yml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: self-serve/v1
kind: ResourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: connector-rules
spec:
  targetKind: Connector
  description: "Restricts connector plugin classes and task limits"
  rules:
    - condition: >
        spec.config["connector.class"] in [
          "io.connect.jdbc.JdbcSourceConnector",
          "io.connect.jdbc.JdbcSinkConnector",
          "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
          "org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.MirrorSourceConnector",
          "com.amazonaws.kafka.connect.s3.S3SinkConnector"
        ]
      errorMessage: "Only approved connector classes are allowed — contact the platform team to request a new class"
    - condition: int(spec.config["tasks.max"]) <= 8
      errorMessage: "tasks.max cannot exceed 8"
```

## ApplicationGroup restrictions (`appgroup-restrictions.yml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: self-serve/v1
kind: ResourcePolicy
metadata:
  name: appgroup-restrictions

  targetKind: ApplicationGroup
  description: "Enforces group-based membership and restricts production permissions"
  rules:
    - condition: "!has(spec.members) || spec.members.size() == 0"
      errorMessage: "Direct user membership is not allowed — use externalGroups to manage membership via your identity provider"
    - condition: >
        spec.permissions
            .filter(p, p.appInstance.endsWith("-prod") && p.resourceType == "TOPIC")
            .all(p, p.permissions.all(perm, perm in ["topicConsume", "topicViewConfig", "topicDataQualityManage"]))
      errorMessage: "For production topics, only consume, view config, and manage data quality are allowed"
```
