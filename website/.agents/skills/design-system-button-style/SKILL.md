# Design System Button Style

## Intent

Keep buttons compact and space-efficient for developer tooling interfaces.
Use minimal spacing by default, then increase spacing only when the UI becomes cluttered or hard to scan.

## Default Button Baseline

Use this baseline for secondary utility actions:

```tsx
<Button
  type="button"
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  className="h-7 px-2 text-[11px]"
>
  Close
</Button>
```

## Compactness Rules

1. Default to compact button density (`h-7`, tight horizontal padding, small text).
2. Prefer `size="sm"` unless the button is a primary CTA that needs stronger emphasis.
3. Keep action rows tight first; expand spacing only if adjacent controls feel visually merged.
4. Increase spacing in small increments (for example, `gap-1` -> `gap-1.5` -> `gap-2`), not large jumps.
5. Maintain consistency across sibling actions in the same surface.

## Tailwind Guidance

- Start with compact values: `h-7`, `px-2`, `text-[11px]`.
- Use larger values only with clear UX need (readability, touch target, or visual hierarchy).
- Match existing design language in nearby components before introducing a new button pattern.

## Apply This Skill When

- Adding a new `Button` in popup/library UI.
- Adjusting spacing between buttons or action controls.
- Refactoring component cards/modals/rails where density matters.
- Reviewing UI changes for compactness and consistency.

## Quick Review Checklist

- [ ] Button uses compact baseline unless there is a justified exception.
- [ ] Spacing is minimal but not crowded.
- [ ] Sibling actions look visually consistent.
- [ ] Any larger sizing choice is intentional and tied to hierarchy/usability.
